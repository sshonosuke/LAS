# LAS: Log-adjusted shrinkage prior for signal estimation

This repository provides R code implementing spatially clustered regression for spatial data analysis, as proposed by the following paper.


[Hamura, H., Irie, K. and Sugasawa, S. (2020). Shrinkage with robustness: log-adjusted heavy-tailed priors. *arXiv:2001.08465*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08465)

The repository includes the following 2 files.

* LAS-function.R : Script implementing the proposed method
* simulation.R : Script applying the proposed prios and some existing ones to simulated datasets
